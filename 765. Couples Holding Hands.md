        [(0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7),(8,9)] -> Aim (Put pairs adjacent)
  
        Mark parent of both 0,1 -> 0
        Mark parent of both 2,3 -> 2
        Mark parent of both 4,5 -> 4
        .
        . 
        Mark parent of both 8,9 -> 8
            
        Converted row after marking parent, e.g replace odd number n by  n-1
        
        [(0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8)]
            
        Now if we draw edge from index 0 to index 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 5, of row..   we have 5 connected components
        
         __               __              __             __         __          
        /  \             /  \            /  \           /  \       /  \
        \  /             \  /            \  /           \  /       \  /
          0                2               4              6          8
            
        Now, we have here n/2 = (10/2) = 5 connected components, 
        So, for fulfilling the creteria we have to convert the given graph into n/2 
        connected components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        How can we do this,
        
        [(0,2),(1,3),(6,5),(8,7),(4,9)] -> Assume Given row
        
        Mark parent of (0,1) -> 0
        Mark parent of (2,3) -> 2
        Mark parent of (4,5) -> 4
        .
        . 
        Mark parent of (8,9) -> 8
            
        Converted row after marking parent
        
        [(0,0),(0,2),(6,4),(8,6),(4,8)]
        
        Now if we draw edge from index 0 to index 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 5, of row... we have 2 connected components
            
         __
        /  \
        \  / 
          0------2     
            
               6 
              / \
             /   \
            8-----4
             
        But our aim is to convert the graph into n/2 connected components
            
        Hence, required number of connected components = n/2 - current connected components
                                                       = 4 - 2
                                                       = 2 (Our required number of swaps)
            
        For this type of graph, we can see that there can be atmost 2 edges for any vertices
        So by swapping any one pair the number of components will increased by 1
            
        So, after making 3 swaps 
            * index 1 and index 2  -> [(0,1),(2,3),(6,5),(8,7),(4,9)]
            * index 5 and index 7  -> [(0,1),(2,3),(6,7),(8,5),(4,9)]
            * index 6 and index 8  -> [(0,1),(2,3),(6,7),(4,5),(8,9)]
        
        We reached to destination
            
```            
   ALGO:
   * If number n is odd, then  replace it by (n-1) for marking parent.
   * Draw undirected graph b/w adjacent values (index0 <--> index1, index2 <--> index3, .....) 
   * Count connected components c
   * return (N/2 -c) 
```

Code:

```
class Solution {
public:
    
    //visit
    void visit(int curr, vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &vis)
    {
        if(vis[curr]==1) return;
        vis[curr]=1;
        
        for(auto x:adj[curr])
        {
            visit(x,adj,vis);
        }
    }
    
    int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row) {
        
        //marking parent
        for(auto &x:row) if(x%2) x=x-1; 
        
        int n=row.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n+1);
        
        //create adjacency matrix
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i+=2)
        {
            adj[row[i]].push_back(row[i+1]); 
            adj[row[i+1]].push_back(row[i]); 
        }
        
        //connected components
        int c=0;
        
        //visited array
        vector<int> vis(n+1,0);
        
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i+=2)
        {
            if(i%2==0)   //we have only even numbers in our graph
            { 
               if(vis[i]==0)  //if unvisited
               {
                   visit(i,adj,vis);  //visit all it connected elements
                   c++;               //increment connected component by 1
               }
            }
        } 
         
        return n/2-c;
        
    }
};
```
