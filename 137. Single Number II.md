**lets array is [2,2,3,2,3,4,3]
Number binary form
2 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 0 1 0

2 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 0 1 0

3 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 0 1 1

2 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 0 1 0

3 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 0 1 1

4 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 1 0 0

3 ->   ---------------------------_____           0 0 1 1

Sum of total at every index _____                 0 1 6 3

Taking mod by 3 at every index     _              0 1 0 0  (0%3=0 , 1%3=1 , 6%3=0 , 3%3=0)

Now it is (0100) is binary form of final result i.e 4 is final answer.

 * if number present 3 times then by taking modulo 3 we will eleminate it's bit from result
 * If sum of every index bits taken mod 3 is 0 means that there is no set bit result bit
 * If sum of every index bits taken mod 3 is 1 means that there is set bit result bit
 * Now we will get final result by bits taken by mod and generate decimal form of bits**
 
         for negative single number , check if result in nums or not if not return -res || see solution
```

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long int res=0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++)
        {   int p=0;
            for(int j=0;j<nums.size();j++)
            {   
			    int k=abs(nums[j]);
                p+=(k&(1<<i))!=0?1:0;    //by shifting 1 to left ith time and taking and with1  will give us 
				                                         //that ith bit of nums[j] is 1 or 0
            } 
           p%=3; 
          res+=pow(2,i)*p;
        } 
		/*
		**To handle if res is -ve**
		 We have calculated our result positive number
		 But there may be chance that single number may be negative
		 Eg.array= [2,2,-4,2]
		 Here after bitwise calculation our res will store 4 
		 but you see that 4 is not present in  our array.
		 So , we will check if res (4) is present in array or not
		 if present , then return it else res must be -ve
		 Hence return -res (-4):

        for(auto x:nums)   //for negative numbers
          if(x==res) {c++;}   //if our calculates value res is present in array, then increment c
