**TOPIC: UNION FIND
   NOT A BIG TASK :), JUST GO LINE BY LINE** 

       In union we just make any element leader of any group and make other elements as a group member.

**Let's say 1 and 2 are friend , and 2 and 3 are also friend 
Then indirectly 1 and 3 are also friends. We can say that 1,2,3 are in same group.**

How we will deal with it in UNION:

WE have given **n * n matrix** , then **maximum number of group will be n**, if nobody is friend of none.

Lets Say n=5
Now we mark all of them initially with -1, because at starting all are alone, all are self leader.
**At the end we will find -1 for those index which will be leader of any group**

 _INDEX :     **[ 1 ,  2 ,3 ,4 ,   5]**
VALUES: **[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]**

Now **1 is friend of 2**, mark **2** as a leader , how can we do this, simple ,**point index 2 from 1**
 _INDEX :     **[ 1 ,  2 ,3 ,4 ,   5]**
VALUES: **[  2,-1,-1,-1, -1]**
Here how we will find leader ,start from index 1

**1 is pointing 2 , 1->2
2 is pointing -1, 2 is leader of group**


Now **2 is friend of 3**, Now **point 2 at index 3**
 _INDEX :     **[ 1 ,  2 ,3 ,4 ,   5]**
VALUES: **[  2 , 3,-1,-1, -1]**

**1 is pointing 2 , 1->2
2 is pointing 3 , 2->3
3 is pointing -1 , 3 is leader of group**


Now if we start finding **leader of 1 and 2** , then **3** is the leader (**COMMON LEADER: SAME GROUP**)

Now **4 is friend of 5**, Now **point 4 at index 5**
 _INDEX :     **[ 1 ,  2 ,3 ,4 ,   5]**
VALUES: **[  2 , 3,-1, 5, -1]**

Now we have **two** groups **{1,2,3}** and **{4,5}** , NOW go to solution line by line :)

         and now main leader of whole group is leader of 2nd member

***Time Complexity: O(N^3)
Space Complexity: O(N)***  

**We are traversing N * N size matrix and finding parent each time in vector  of size N
Using a vector to store parent of size N**
