**Note:** 
**You have to try everything to declare Alice as a winner** because **he is** **starting the game** and **he will play optimally** and bob will take move according  to moves of alice. If after all combination alice can't win then declare Bob winner.

        Alice always start first, So if number is perfect square then alice will win always
        We will go previous stage by subtracting perfect square <= N

**Here game start :)**

*         Current Stage: Alice start game, Alice subtract every perfect square<=N
*         i.e N= -> [N-9], [N-4] , [N-1]
*         Reach at Previous Stage: It's bob chance

**Here If at any stage (N-9 or N-4 or N-1) bob is winner then the winner of this Game N will be ALICE.**

```
WHY?????????????
```
        Think previous stage [N-9] if bob wins , 
        If Given number is [N-9] , then it will be fresh game and Alice will start but here
        We found that Bob is winner, 
		
		Means At this stage (N-perfect square) the person who will start the game will lose .
		
        So at this stage now Bob reaches when Given N and Alice subtract a perfect square
        So Bob will lose and Alice will win the game for given N.
		
		
		
		Think previous stage [N-9] if Alice wins , Then everything will be reverse
		[N-9] new Game , Alice start and Alice is winner.
		
		Means At this stage (N-perfect square) the person who will start the game will win .
		
		So at this stage now Bob reaches when Given N and Alice subtract a perfect square
        So Bob will win and Alice will lose the game for given N.
		
**Keep in mind starting NOTE of post,**

		You have to try everything to declare Alice as a winner because he is starting the
		game and he will play optimally and bob will take move according to moves of 
		alice. If after all combination alice can't win then declare Bob winner.
		
		
		
**Final:**
        
       ```If any previous stage Bob is winner then Alice is winner of current stage N.```
	   
**See the code now :)**

```
class Solution {
public:
   
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        
       //Used to store previous stage 
       vector<char> v(n+1);
        
        //for N=1, Alice will be winner, 1 is perfect square 1-1=0 bob have no
        //oppertunaty
       v[1]='A';
        
        //Store the perfect square till n
       vector<int> sqr;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            if(floor(sqrt(i))==ceil(sqrt(i))) sqr.push_back(i);
        }  
		
       //Start from =2 to n 
       for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)
       {
          //Perfect square Alice is winner of this stage 
          if(floor(sqrt(i))==ceil(sqrt(i))){ v[i]='A';continue; }
           
          //Go to previous stage 
          int j=0,c=0;
          while(j<sqr.size()&&i-sqr[j]>=0)
          {    
              //If at previous stage Bob is winner then 
              //According to explanation Alice is winner :) of current stage
              if(v[i-sqr[j]]=='B') {v[i]='A';c=1;break;}
              j++;
          }
           
           //We did't found bob in previous stage then Bob is winner :(
           if(!c) v[i]='B';
       }
       
        //return the verdict
       return v[n]=='A'?1:0; 
    }
};
